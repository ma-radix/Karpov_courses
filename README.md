# Karpov-python
This repository contains assignments and projects from Karpov's courses. The py folder contains jupiter notebooks, the sql folder contains text files with code and visualisations made in redash.

The main purpose of the existence of this repository for me is to quickly find projects for examples and view the logic of thought on previous versions.

All data was provided by Karpov courses and if you think that your company's personal data is leaked here - you think so:)
